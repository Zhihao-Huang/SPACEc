# TODO

- [ ] Milestone 1
    - [ ] tests
        - [x] setup tests
        - [ ] write all tests
        - [ ] fix TODOs with Yuqi
    - [ ] modularize: pl (plot?), tl (tools), hp (helper), pp (preprocessing)
        - [x] initial modularization
        - [ ] **Yuqi:** what is the difference between tools and helpers?
            - [ ] helpers are "minor" function ... potentially arbitrary 
            - [ ] for now: any helper that is not used standalone move to tools
        - [ ] **Yuqi:** segmentation stuff should be moved to different files?
        - [ ] **Yuqi:** some stuff plots even though it is not called `pl`!
    - [ ] docs
        - [x] move docs to markdown
        - [ ] tutorial notebooks
    - [ ] timings of notebooks
        - [ ] based on what data?
    - [ ] optional
        - [ ] make files smaller; they are way too long (modularize)
    - [ ] **Yuqi**
        - [ ] send qpdiff (optimally downsized)
